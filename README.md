## :scroll: Description
Hello People, Welcome to Bark.Cafeüêæ.  
Through this app, you can adopt cute little puppies and turn your home into Pawradise ‚ù§Ô∏è



## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Built with:
-   [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)  - Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI.
-   [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)  - First class and official programming language for Android development.
-   [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.  
  
As a part of #AndroidDevChallenge I learnt few basic concepts of Jetpack Compose and build this app. Developing an app with Jetpack Compose was an amazing experience.
